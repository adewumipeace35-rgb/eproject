                    <h5><i>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Education</i></h5>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to simulate human intelligence, capable of performing tasks such as problem-solving, reasoning, decision-making, and providing feedback in real time (Alimisis, 2013; Holmes et al., 2019). In the context of education, AI has been increasingly applied to enhance teaching and learning processes by offering personalized learning experiences, monitoring student progress, and adapting instructional content to meet individual learners’ needs (Luckin et al., 2016; Roll & Wylie, 2016). AI tools can also analyze students’ responses, identify misconceptions, and provide instant feedback, which helps to improve understanding and retention. The integration of AI in classrooms has become particularly important as educators seek to complement traditional teaching methods with technology that can support interactive and self-directed learning. For secondary school students studying biology, AI presents opportunities for more engaging and efficient learning, especially in areas where learners struggle with complex or abstract concepts (Goel et al., 2021; Almaiah et al., 2020). This study focuses on AI in the form of chatbots, examining how students perceive their usefulness as virtual tutors in understanding biology topics.</p>
                    <h5><i>AI Chatbots</i></h5>
                    <p>AI chatbots are computer programs that simulate human conversation, allowing students to interact with them through text or voice (Fryer & Carpenter, 2020; Winkler & Söllner, 2018). In educational settings, chatbots serve as digital assistants, providing explanations, answering questions, and guiding learners through lessons. They are particularly useful for subjects like biology, where students often encounter challenging topics that require step-by-step clarification. Research shows that AI chatbots can offer personalized learning experiences by adjusting responses based on the student’s level of understanding, giving immediate feedback, and reinforcing classroom teaching (Almaiah et al., 2020; Goel et al., 2021). In this study, AI chatbots function as virtual tutors, supporting secondary school students in Ekiti State to understand selected biology concepts more effectively while also allowing learners to engage with content at their own pace.</p>
                    <h5><i>Virtual Tutors</i></h5>
                    <p>A virtual tutor is a digital learning tool designed to guide students through lessons in a way similar to a human teacher, providing explanations, answering questions, and offering feedback (Woolf, 2010; Roll & Wylie, 2016). Virtual tutors can support self-paced learning, help clarify difficult concepts, and reinforce knowledge gained in the classroom. In the context of biology education, virtual tutors are particularly valuable because students often struggle with abstract topics such as cell structures, genetics, and ecological systems. AI chatbots, when functioning as virtual tutors, can scaffold learning by presenting information interactively, addressing misconceptions immediately, and offering repeated explanations until the student demonstrates understanding (Almaiah et al., 2020; Goel et al., 2021). This functionality allows learners to engage more actively with the content and enhances comprehension, making AI chatbots a potentially effective tool for improving student learning outcomes in biology.</p>
                    <h5><i>Student Perception in Learning</i></h5>
                    <p>Perception in learning refers to students’ attitudes, opinions, beliefs, or feelings toward a particular learning tool or method (Davis, 1989; Almarashdeh et al., 2016). In the context of educational technology, students’ perception influences their willingness to engage with tools such as AI chatbots and can affect learning outcomes (Teo, 2011; Ifenthaler & Schweinbenz, 2013). Positive perception occurs when students find a tool useful, easy to use, and effective in supporting their learning, while negative perception can reduce motivation and limit the adoption of the tool. Understanding students’ perception is particularly important in biology education, where abstract concepts can pose learning challenges. By assessing how students perceive AI chatbots as virtual tutors, this study seeks to determine whether such technology is likely to be embraced and whether it can enhance students’ understanding of selected biology topics.</p>
                    <h5><i>Biology Concepts in Secondary Schools</i></h5>
                    <p>Biology is a core science subject in secondary schools that involves the study of living organisms, their structures, functions, and interactions with the environment (Osundina, 2018; Ibe, 2019). Common topics include cell biology, genetics, and ecology, which often challenge students due to their abstract nature and complexity. Teaching biology effectively requires strategies that allow learners to visualize concepts, engage in critical thinking, and apply knowledge to real-life situations. Traditional teaching methods, which rely heavily on lectures and rote memorization, sometimes fail to meet these needs, resulting in misconceptions and poor retention (Osundina, 2018). Integrating technology, such as AI chatbots acting as virtual tutors, provides additional support by offering interactive explanations, immediate feedback, and self-paced learning opportunities. This approach can help students understand difficult biology concepts more thoroughly, reinforce classroom instruction, and improve overall learning outcomes (Almaiah et al., 2020; Goel et al., 2021).</p>
                    <h5><i>AI Chatbots and Learning of Biology</i></h5>
                    <p>The use of AI chatbots in learning biology has gained attention due to their potential to enhance understanding of complex and abstract concepts. Studies have shown that chatbots can provide personalized instruction, instant feedback, and interactive explanations, which help students engage more actively with biology concepts (Almaiah et al., 2020; Goel et al., 2021). By functioning as virtual tutors, AI chatbots allow learners to progress at their own pace, revisit difficult concepts, and clarify misconceptions immediately. This technology also supports collaborative and self-directed learning, making it easier for students to understand scientific processes and relationships. In addition, AI chatbots can complement traditional teaching methods by reinforcing lessons delivered in the classroom, thereby improving comprehension and retention of biology content (Fryer & Carpenter, 2020; Roll & Wylie, 2016). Understanding students’ perception of AI chatbots in biology learning is therefore essential, as positive perception can influence their willingness to adopt these tools and maximize their educational benefits.</p>

            <h4 id="theoretical">Theoretical Framework</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>This study is anchored on three interrelated theoretical frameworks that provide a foundation for understanding students’ perception of AI chatbots as virtual tutors in biology education: The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Constructivist Learning Theory, and Vygotsky’s Social Interaction Theory. Together, these frameworks explain both why students may adopt chatbots and how these tools can facilitate meaningful learning experiences.</p>
                    <button class="more">Read More</button>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <h5><i>Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)</i></h5>
                    <p>The primary theoretical anchor for this study is the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by Davis (1989). TAM is widely used to understand and predict users’ acceptance and adoption of new technologies in educational and organizational contexts. The model posits that two key factors determine a user’s acceptance and use of technology:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Perceived Usefulness (PU):</b>This refers to the extent to which a student believes that using an AI chatbot will enhance their learning and academic performance in biology. When students perceive the chatbot as a tool that can improve comprehension, facilitate understanding of complex biology concepts, and support academic success, they are more likely to adopt and engage with it (Almarashdeh et al., 2016; Adeyemi & Adeyinka, 2020).</li>
                        <li><b>Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU):</b>This refers to the extent to which a student believes that interacting with the AI chatbot will be effortless and free from cognitive strain. When students find the chatbot intuitive, user-friendly, and simple to navigate, they are more likely to use it consistently and explore its features to support learning (Teo, 2011; Almaiah et al., 2020).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>According to TAM, these two perceptions—usefulness and ease of use—directly influence students’ attitudes toward the technology, their behavioural intention to use it, and ultimately their actual use of the technology. In other words, if students perceive the AI chatbot as helpful and easy to use, they are more likely to adopt it as a learning tool, which in turn can enhance their understanding of biology concepts.</p>
                    <p>TAM is directly relevant to this study because the research seeks to measure these exact constructs among secondary school students in Ekiti State. By applying TAM, the study not only examines the students’ perception of AI chatbots but also predicts their likelihood of integrating this technology into their learning routines. This framework provides a clear explanation for how students’ attitudes and beliefs about AI chatbots may affect their engagement, motivation, and overall academic performance in biology. Furthermore, TAM has been validated in various educational studies globally, providing a strong theoretical foundation for assessing technology adoption in the context of secondary school science education (Almaiah et al., 2020; Fryer & Carpenter, 2020).</p>
                    <h5><i>Constructivist Learning Theory</i></h5>
                    <p>Complementing the Technology Acceptance Model, this study is also anchored in Constructivist Learning Theory, associated with theorists such as Piaget (1972) and Vygotsky (1978). Constructivism posits that learners actively construct their own knowledge and understanding by engaging with experiences, reflecting on them, and integrating new information with prior knowledge (Bruner, 1990; Okeke, 2017). Learning is viewed as a dynamic process where students build understanding through interaction, exploration, and problem-solving, rather than passively receiving information from a teacher.</p>
                    <p>AI chatbots align effectively with this theory because they provide a digital platform that can simulate interactive, scaffolded, and self-directed learning experiences.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Providing Scaffolding:</b>AI chatbots can offer tailored support to students as they navigate complex biology concepts, such as genetics, cell biology, or ecological relationships. By providing step-by-step explanations and gradually reducing assistance as the learner gains competence, chatbots exemplify Vygotsky’s (1978) concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), where learners perform tasks just beyond their current ability with guided support.</li>
                        <li><b>Promoting Active Learning:</b>Constructivist theory emphasizes the importance of active engagement in knowledge construction. Chatbots encourage students to formulate questions, evaluate feedback, and interact with content, which fosters critical thinking and deep understanding. Studies have shown that interactive digital tools promote active learning by requiring learners to respond, reflect, and correct misconceptions in real time (Almaiah et al., 2020; Ifenthaler & Schweinbenz, 2013).</li>
                        <li><b>Enabling Personalized Learning:</b> Chatbots allow students to learn at their own pace and explore topics according to individual needs and prior knowledge. This personalization supports differentiated learning, allowing students with varying levels of understanding to progress without being constrained by the pace of the whole class. Research indicates that self-paced, personalized learning environments increase engagement and retention, particularly in subjects like biology that involve abstract and challenging concepts (Ogunyemi & Ojo, 2021; Ibe, 2019).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5><i>Vygotsky’s Social Interaction Theory</i></h5>
                    <p>Lev Vygotsky’s Social Interaction Theory emphasizes that learning is a fundamentally social process and that knowledge is co-constructed through interaction with more knowledgeable others (Vygotsky, 1978). Central to this theory is the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which refers to the gap between what a learner can achieve independently and what they can accomplish with guidance and support. In traditional classrooms, teachers, peers, or instructional materials often provide this scaffolding. However, in the context of technology-enhanced learning, AI-powered tools such as chatbots can play a similar role.</p>
                    <p>AI chatbots, when used as virtual tutors, can serve as the “more knowledgeable other” by providing timely explanations, hints, and clarifications that help students progress from their current level of understanding towards higher competence. For example, a student struggling with abstract biology concepts like photosynthesis or genetics could receive step-by-step explanations and interactive questioning from the chatbot, simulating a guided dialogue with a tutor. This aligns with Vygotsky’s idea that language and dialogue are central tools for cognitive development.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the interactive nature of chatbots supports collaborative learning. Even when learners are studying individually, the chatbot provides a conversational partner, encouraging reflection, questioning, and the active construction of meaning. This mirrors the social interaction that Vygotsky highlighted as critical for internalizing new knowledge. In classroom settings, chatbots can also complement peer learning by freeing up teachers to focus on more complex interactions while students receive basic scaffolding from the chatbot.</p>
                    <p>In the Nigerian context, where large class sizes and limited teacher-student interaction are common challenges, Vygotsky’s theory provides a strong rationale for integrating chatbots into biology education. The chatbot can act as an ever-present scaffold, reducing the cognitive load on learners and supporting them within their ZPD. This enhances personalized learning opportunities and ensures that students do not fall behind due to lack of individualized teacher attention.</p>
                    <p>Thus, Vygotsky’s Social Interaction Theory complements TAM in this study: while TAM explains students’ acceptance and intention to use AI chatbots, Vygotsky’s framework explains how the chatbot, once adopted, can mediate learning and foster deeper understanding of biology concepts.</p>
                    <h5><i>Synthesis of the Frameworks</i></h5>
                    <p>Taken together, these three frameworks provide a comprehensive lens for this study. The Technology Acceptance Model explains the determinants of student adoption of AI chatbots based on their perceptions of usefulness and ease of use. Constructivist Learning Theory explains how students learn through active engagement with the chatbot, while Vygotsky’s Social Interaction Theory highlights the social and dialogic nature of learning that chatbots can foster. By combining cognitive, experiential, and social dimensions of learning, these theories justify the investigation of students’ perception of AI chatbots as virtual tutors in biology education.</p>

            <h4 id="empirical">Empirical Review</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>This section examines empirical studies on the application of AI chatbots in education, the influence of student perception on technology adoption, and the integration of technology in science teaching within Nigeria. The review synthesizes findings from both global and local research to provide a foundation for the present study. Evidence from international studies indicates that AI chatbots enhance learning outcomes, engagement, and self-directed learning, while Nigerian studies confirm the positive impact of technology integration in science education. However, there remains a significant gap in research specifically exploring students’ perception of AI chatbots as virtual tutors for biology in Nigerian secondary schools, a gap that this study aims to address.</p>
                    <button class="more">Read More</button>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <h5><i>Studies on AI and Chatbots in Education Globally</i></h5>
                    <p>The application of artificial intelligence in education has received significant attention internationally, demonstrating its capacity to enhance learning, engagement, and student performance. AI chatbots, in particular, have emerged as effective virtual tutors capable of providing personalized instruction, instant feedback, and continuous support outside traditional classroom settings. Zawacki-Richter et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of AI in education, identifying key areas such as intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive learning platforms, and predictive analytics, all of which generally improve student outcomes by addressing individual learning needs.</p>
                    <p>Specific studies highlight the role of chatbots in facilitating interactive and self-directed learning. Chandrasekaran (2021) reported that a physics tutoring chatbot improved students’ conceptual understanding and engagement by offering step-by-step explanations, immediate clarification of doubts, and opportunities for self-paced practice. Similarly, Fryer and Carpenter (2020) found that chatbots, when implemented as virtual tutors, reinforced classroom instruction, encouraged active participation, and supported individualized learning pathways. Goel et al. (2021) further emphasized that AI-driven tutoring systems can scaffold complex topics, helping students internalize abstract concepts through adaptive and iterative learning interactions.</p>
                    <p>AI chatbots have also been shown to foster motivation and improve learning behaviors. Winkler and Söllner (2018) found that chatbots that provide timely feedback and interactive guidance increase student engagement and persistence in learning tasks. Holmes et al. (2019) highlighted that AI tutoring systems promote self-regulated learning, allowing students to reflect on their answers, monitor their progress, and revisit difficult topics as needed. These findings suggest that AI chatbots are not only useful for providing academic support but also for cultivating independent learning skills that are essential in mastering complex subjects such as biology.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, the literature also points to potential challenges that could negatively influence student perception. These include the risk of chatbots providing incorrect or incomplete information (Winkler & Söllner, 2018), the inherent limitations in handling highly complex or nuanced student queries (Fryer & Carpenter, 2020), and the possible absence of the emotional support and motivational empathy that a human tutor provides (Holmes et al., 2019). Furthermore, successful implementation is often dependent on reliable technological infrastructure—such as stable internet connectivity and access to digital devices—which cannot be assumed in all educational contexts. For this study, acknowledging these potential drawbacks is crucial, as they likely inform the very student perceptions under investigation, particularly in the resource-constrained setting of Nigerian public schools.</p>
                    <p>Despite the promising outcomes demonstrated internationally, much of the research has focused on subjects like mathematics, physics, or general e-learning contexts, with limited attention to biology education. Given the abstract nature of many biology concepts, including cell biology, genetics, and ecological systems, AI chatbots have the potential to provide scaffolding and interactive learning experiences that could significantly enhance student comprehension. However, empirical studies examining their effectiveness in biology and understanding students’ perception in adopting these tools remain scarce, underscoring the relevance of the present study in exploring AI chatbots as virtual tutors for secondary school biology students in Nigeria.</p>
                    <h5><i>Studies on Technology Acceptance and Student Perception</i></h5>
                    <p>The adoption of technology in educational settings is strongly influenced by students’ perception, which determines whether a tool is willingly used and how effectively it supports learning. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by Davis (1989) has been widely applied to explain technology adoption in education. According to TAM, two main constructs—perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use—predict users’ attitudes, behavioral intention, and actual usage of a technology. In practical terms, a student is more likely to adopt an AI chatbot if they believe it can enhance their understanding of biology (usefulness) and if it is simple to interact with (ease of use).</p>
                    <p>Empirical studies internationally support this framework. Šumak et al. (2017) found that perceived usefulness and ease of use were strong predictors of students’ intention to use e-learning systems. Similarly, Almaiah et al. (2020) emphasized that students’ perception of technology directly affects their engagement and learning outcomes, noting that digital tools perceived as difficult to use are often abandoned, regardless of their potential benefits. Venkatesh et al. (2003) also reported that additional factors, such as perceived enjoyment, relevance to coursework, and system interactivity, play a significant role in students’ adoption of technology. This implies that for AI chatbots to be effective in supporting biology learning, they must not only be functional but also engaging and relevant to students’ academic needs.</p>
                    <p>In the Nigerian context, studies examining student perception of educational technology are limited but growing. Ibe (2019) observed that secondary school students’ willingness to adopt e-learning tools depended heavily on their perception of how useful and easy these tools were in enhancing learning. Similarly, Adeyemi and Adeyinka (2020) found that students’ positive perception of digital resources significantly increased their engagement, motivation, and academic performance in science subjects. Despite these insights, there is little research on students’ perception of AI chatbots specifically, particularly in the context of learning biology concepts. Understanding students’ perception is crucial because it not only predicts adoption but also shapes how effectively AI chatbots can be integrated as virtual tutors to support self-directed, scaffolded, and personalized learning.</p>
                    <p>In summary, the literature underscores that students’ perception is a key determinant of the successful implementation of technology in education. While international studies provide a broad understanding of TAM in action, and Nigerian studies highlight perception’s importance in ICT adoption, the specific intersection of student perception, AI chatbots, and secondary school biology education remains underexplored. This gap reinforces the necessity of the present study, which seeks to examine how students in Ekiti State perceive AI chatbots as virtual tutors for learning biology concepts.</p>
                    <h5><i>Studies on Technology Integration in Science Education in Nigeria</i></h5>
                    <p>In Nigeria, several studies have explored the integration of technology into science education, particularly in biology, and have generally reported positive impacts on students’ understanding and engagement. For example, Adeyemi (2018) examined the use of computer simulations in teaching biology and found that students exposed to simulations demonstrated improved comprehension of complex biological processes, such as cell division and genetics, compared to those taught using traditional lecture methods. Similarly, Olagunju (2020) reported that digital animations and interactive visual aids enhance students’ ability to visualize and internalize abstract biological concepts, leading to better retention and academic performance.</p>
                    <p>Mobile learning and e-learning platforms have also been investigated as tools for enhancing science education in Nigeria. Adedoja and Abiodun (2019) found that mobile learning applications facilitate self-paced study, provide instant feedback, and encourage active participation, even outside the classroom. These tools are particularly useful in contexts where classroom instruction may be limited by large class sizes or insufficient laboratory facilities. Studies by Afolabi and Oladipo (2020) similarly highlighted that digital resources can increase students’ motivation and engagement by offering interactive and immersive learning experiences that traditional methods may lack.</p>
                    <p>Despite these advancements, most studies in Nigeria focus on teacher-led ICT integration or general digital tools rather than student-centered AI applications, such as chatbots. There is limited empirical evidence on how students themselves interact with AI-driven technologies, how these tools influence learning, and how students perceive their usefulness and ease of use. Furthermore, very few studies address secondary school biology specifically, where conceptual challenges often hinder effective learning. This indicates a need for research on AI chatbots as virtual tutors, particularly in the Nigerian context, where infrastructure, curriculum, and student readiness can influence adoption and effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>By examining students’ perception and interaction with AI chatbots in biology, the present study seeks to address this gap. It will provide insights into how AI tools can be integrated into Nigerian secondary school classrooms to enhance understanding of challenging biology concepts and support independent learning. The findings are expected to inform both instructional strategies and policy decisions regarding the implementation of AI-driven educational technologies in science education.</p>

            <h4 id="gap">Research Gap</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>A thorough review of both local and international literature reveals several critical gaps that justify the need for the present study. Firstly, most studies on AI chatbots in education have focused on subjects such as mathematics, physics, or general e-learning environments, leaving a significant gap in research on biology. Biology is a subject that involves abstract and complex concepts such as genetics, cell structures, ecological relationships, and physiological processes, which students often find difficult to understand through traditional teaching methods. There is limited empirical evidence on how AI chatbots can support students in mastering these specific biology concepts, highlighting the need for subject-specific investigation.</p>
                    <button class="more">Read More</button>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <p>Secondly, there is a contextual gap in Nigerian secondary schools. Existing research on technology integration in science education within Nigeria has largely examined teacher-led ICT tools, including computer simulations, animations, and mobile learning applications. These studies rarely focus on student-centered AI tools, such as chatbots, and almost none have explored their use in secondary schools in Ekiti State. Students’ engagement and learning outcomes with AI tools may be influenced by local factors, including infrastructure, teacher support, and curriculum alignment, making it crucial to study AI chatbots in this specific context.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, insufficient attention has been paid to students’ perception of AI chatbots. International studies indicate that learners’ attitudes towards educational technology—such as perceived usefulness, ease of use, and engagement—strongly influence adoption and learning outcomes. However, Nigerian studies have not adequately explored how students perceive AI chatbots in biology education. Understanding these perceptions is essential for predicting whether students will adopt and effectively use AI chatbots as virtual tutors.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, there is a lack of research integrating pedagogical and technological factors. While some studies examine either technology effectiveness or adoption separately, few investigate the combination of constructivist principles—such as scaffolding, active learning, and personalized learning—with the students’ perception of AI chatbots. This theoretical and practical gap limits understanding of how AI chatbots can be optimally designed and implemented to facilitate learning in biology.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is limited evidence on practical implementation and scalability of AI chatbots in Nigerian secondary schools. Most studies remain experimental or conducted in controlled settings abroad, with little attention to real-world classroom conditions. This gap emphasizes the need for context-specific, empirical research to explore how AI chatbots can be adopted effectively, how they can support learning of abstract biology concepts, and what factors influence their success in the Nigerian educational environment. Addressing these gaps will provide crucial insights into students’ perception, adoption, and effective use of AI chatbots, thereby informing instructional strategies, curriculum development, and policy decisions in biology education.</p>

            <h4 id="summary">Summary of Literature Review</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>This chapter has examined the key concepts, theoretical underpinnings, and empirical studies related to the perception of students on the use of AI chatbots as virtual tutors in the learning of biology. The conceptual review explained the role of artificial intelligence in education, the nature and functions of chatbots, their application as virtual tutors, and the importance of student perception in technology adoption. It also explored the challenges of learning biology in secondary schools and the potential of AI chatbots to address these challenges. The theoretical framework drew on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Constructivist Learning Theory, and Vygotsky’s Social Interaction Theory to explain how students’ perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, and interactive learning can shape their acceptance and utilization of AI chatbots in learning.</p>

                <div class="collapse">
                    <p>The empirical review revealed that studies conducted globally have shown positive outcomes in the use of AI chatbots for improving engagement, providing instant feedback, and supporting personalized learning. Research on technology acceptance has consistently highlighted the centrality of students’ perceptions in determining adoption and continued use of educational technologies. In the Nigerian context, studies have mostly focused on ICT tools such as animations, simulations, and mobile learning in teaching science subjects, with evidence of improved performance and motivation. However, very few studies have examined AI-driven tools in biology classrooms, and even fewer have investigated secondary school students’ perceptions of chatbots as virtual tutors.</p>
                    <p>From the review, it is evident that although there is a growing global body of knowledge on AI in education and a strong local focus on ICT in science teaching, there remains a critical gap in empirical research on AI chatbots in Nigerian secondary school biology education. This gap is particularly significant because student perception is a major determinant of technology adoption. The present study, therefore, is positioned to fill this void by investigating how secondary school students in Ekiti State perceive the use of AI chatbots as virtual tutors for learning biology concepts.</p>
