            <h4 id="design">Research Design</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>This study adopted a descriptive survey research design. The design was considered appropriate because the study sought to obtain the opinions and perceptions of senior secondary school students regarding the use of AI chatbots as virtual tutors in the learning of biology. </p>

                <div class="collapse">
                    <p>According to Nworgu (2015), the descriptive survey is suitable for studies that aim to collect information from a sample of a population and describe existing conditions, attitudes, or practices without manipulating variables. In this study, the design enabled the researcher to gather systematic data on how students perceive the usefulness, ease of use, and effectiveness of AI chatbots in facilitating their learning of biology concepts.</p>

            <h4 id="total">Population of the Study</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>The population of this study consists of all senior secondary school students within Ikere Local Government Area, Ekiti State who are offering Biology. This group was considered appropriate because Biology is a core science subject at the senior secondary school level and is compulsory for all students in the science class. </p>
                <button class="more">Read More</button>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <p>The study is particularly interested in this population since the perception of students toward the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots as virtual tutors in learning selected concepts in Biology is the central focus of the research.</p>

            <h4 id="sample"> Sample and Sampling Technique</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>The population of this study consisted of all Senior Secondary School students (SSS I–III) offering Biology in public secondary schools within Ikere Local Government Area (LGA) of Ekiti State. This population was considered appropriate because Biology is a compulsory core subject for science students, and the study focuses on students’ perceptions of AI chatbots in learning Biology.</p>

                <div class="collapse">
                    <h5>Sample Size Determination</h5>
                    <p>A sample size of approximately 300–320 students was targeted. This sample was considered adequate and aligns with Creswell (2014), who notes that a sample of 200–300 respondents is sufficient for perception-based survey research. The size also ensured representativeness of the population while maintaining feasibility for data collection.</p>
                    <h5>Sampling Technique</h5>
                    <p>A multi-stage sampling procedure was employed:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stage One – Selection of Schools</li>
                        <p>Convenience sampling was used to select five (5) public secondary schools in Ikere LGA. The choice of convenience sampling was based on accessibility and the willingness of school administrators to grant approval for data collection. To reduce bias, schools were selected from different zones within the LGA.</p>
                        <li>Stage Two – Selection of Classes</li>
                        <p>Within each selected school, cluster sampling was adopted. One intact class was randomly chosen at each of the three senior secondary levels (SSS I, SSS II, and SSS III).</p>
                        <li>Stage Three – Selection of Students</li>
                        <p>All students officially enrolled in Biology in the selected classes automatically formed part of the study sample. This ensured that the sample reflected natural classroom settings and minimized disruption to school activities.</p>
                        <p>This procedure yielded approximately 15 intact classes across the five schools, resulting in a total of about 300–320 participants.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>Justification of the Sampling Method</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The use of multi-stage sampling ensured a balance between representativeness and feasibility.</li>
                        <li>Convenience sampling allowed access to schools willing to participate, which is often necessary in educational research requiring administrative approval.</li>
                        <li>Cluster sampling within intact classes prevented disruption to school routines and allowed the inclusion of diverse student backgrounds.</li>
                        <li>The final sample size is consistent with best practices for quantitative surveys and provides sufficient data for both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis.</li>

            <h4 id="instrument">Research Instrument</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>The primary instrument for data collection in this study was a structured questionnaire titled Students’ Perception of AI Chatbots Questionnaire (SPACQ). The instrument was developed by the researcher, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) and insights from existing literature on students’ use of educational technology and AI-powered learning tools.</p>
                <button class="more">Read More</button>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <p>The SPACQ was designed to generate both quantitative and qualitative data and was divided into six sections:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h5>Section A: Demographic Information</h5>
                        <p>This section obtained background information such as gender, age, class level (SSS I–III), and school name. These variables were used to describe the sample and to analyze possible differences in students’ perceptions across demographic groups.</p>
                        <h5>Section B: Awareness of AI Chatbots</h5>
                        <p>This section consisted of three items measuring students’ prior awareness and experience with AI chatbots. It served as a background measure and was not included in hypothesis testing but provided context for interpreting responses.</p>
                        <h5>Section C: Perceived Usefulness (PU)</h5>
                        <p>This section contained five (5) items assessing the extent to which students believed AI chatbots could enhance their Biology learning. Items focused on understanding of difficult concepts, revision, engagement, and overall improvement in academic performance.</p>
                        <h5>Section D: Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU)</h5>
                        <p>This section contained five (5) items designed to measure students’ perceptions of how easy it would be to use AI chatbots for Biology learning. Items emphasized clarity, accessibility, technical comfort, and minimal effort required.</p>
                        <h5>Section E: Perceived Effectiveness</h5>
                        <p>This section consisted of five (5) items evaluating students’ perceptions of the effectiveness of AI chatbots in improving their confidence, motivation, feedback, and learning pace.</p>
                        <h5>Section F: Open-Ended Questions</h5>
                        <p>This section included two questions that allowed students to provide qualitative responses regarding the challenges they might face using AI chatbots and their suggestions for improving the integration of such tools in Biology education.</p>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Response Format</h5>
                    <p>
                        Items in Sections B–E were measured on a five-point Likert scale:
                        <br>
                        1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree, and 5 = Strongly Agree.
                        <br>
                        Sections A and F used categorical or open-ended responses.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Justification of the Instrument</h5>
                    <p>The use of a structured questionnaire was considered appropriate because it enabled the collection of standardized data from a relatively large sample (300–320 students), ensured comparability of responses across participants, and allowed for both statistical analysis (via Likert-scale items) and thematic insights (via open-ended responses). Moreover, grounding the instrument in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) enhanced its theoretical rigor and ensured that the constructs measured (Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and Perceived Effectiveness) were directly aligned with the study’s objectives.</p>

            <h4 id="valid">Validity of the Instrument</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>To ensure that the Students’ Perception of AI Chatbots Questionnaire (SPACQ) measured what it was designed to measure, several validation procedures were undertaken:</p>
                <button class="more">Read More</button>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <p><b>Content Validity: </b>The initial draft of the questionnaire was developed based on a review of relevant literature and the constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). It was submitted to two experts in Science Education and one expert in Educational Technology for evaluation. They reviewed the instrument for clarity, relevance, and alignment with the study objectives. Their feedback informed revisions to ambiguous items and ensured that each item adequately represented the intended construct.</p>
                    <p><b>Face Validity: </b>To confirm that the items were understandable and appropriate for the target population, the revised questionnaire was administered to 20 senior secondary school students (not included in the main study). Their feedback indicated that the instructions and items were clear and easy to follow.</p>
                    <p><b>Construct Validity: </b>The instrument was structured according to the three main constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model: Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), and Perceived Effectiveness. This ensured that the items aligned with the theoretical framework of the study.</p>
                    <p><b>Pilot Testing: </b>A pilot test was conducted with 30 students from a school outside the study area. Responses were reviewed to check for consistency and item clarity. Minor adjustments were made before final administration.</p>
                    <p>These steps provided evidence that the instrument possessed adequate validity for assessing students’ perceptions of AI chatbots as virtual tutors in Biology.</p>

                </div>
            <h4 id="reliable">Reliability of the Instrument</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>Reliability refers to the consistency of an instrument in measuring what it is intended to measure. The reliability of the Students’ Perception of AI Chatbots Questionnaire (SPACQ) was established through a pilot test.</p>
                <button class="more">Read More</button>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <p>The pilot study, conducted with 30 students outside the main study area, provided data for reliability analysis. Cronbach’s Alpha was used to determine the internal consistency of the Likert-scale items in each construct. The results were as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Perceived Usefulness (PU): </b>α = 0.82</li>
                        <li><b>Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU): </b>α = 0.79</li>
                        <li><b>Perceived Effectiveness: </b> α = 0.85</li>
                        <li><b>Overall Instrument: </b>α = 0.83</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>According to Nunnally (1978), a Cronbach’s Alpha value of 0.70 or above is considered acceptable for research instruments. These results therefore indicate that the SPACQ possesses high internal consistency and is reliable for data collection.</p>

            <h4 id="collect">Method of Data Collection</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>The data for this study were collected using a structured questionnaire administered directly by the researcher. The administration took place within the classroom setting during regular school hours.</p>
                <button class="more">Read More</button>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <h5>Standardized Orientation on AI Chatbots</h5>
                    <p>Prior to the distribution of the questionnaire, a standardized, brief orientation (approximately 5 minutes) was conducted for all participants. This orientation was essential to establish a uniform, informed baseline for students' perceptions, given the study's focus on a technology they may not have previously used.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>The orientation covered:</p>
                        <li><b>Definition and Function: </b>A concise, consistent explanation of what an AI Chatbot is and how it functions as a Virtual Tutor (consistent with the operational definition in Section 1.8), highlighting its potential to offer instant feedback, step-by-step explanations, and support for self-paced learning for difficult biology concepts.</li>
                        <li><b>Simulated Interaction: </b>A brief, verbal illustration of how a student would typically interact with the chatbot (e.g., asking a question about genetics or photosynthesis) and the conversational nature of the response they would receive.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After the orientation, the researcher briefly explained the procedure for completing the questionnaire but did not provide further detailed explanations of the study's purpose to avoid influencing students’ responses to the perception items.</p>
                    <h5>Administration Procedure</h5>
                    <p>Each session lasted approximately 15–20 minutes (including the orientation and questionnaire completion time), during which students were instructed to complete the questionnaire immediately. To ensure smooth administration and maintain order, the researcher was assisted by a researcher’s assistant in each school. Completed questionnaires were retrieved on the spot immediately after completion to minimize the risk of loss or external influence. Only students present at the time of administration participated, and no provision was made for those absent during data collection.</p>

                        <li><b>Descriptive Statistics: </b> Frequency counts, percentages, means, and standard deviations were used to summarize the demographic data and students' responses to the Likert-scale items. This addressed Research Questions 1, 2, 3, and 4.</li>
                        <li>Inferential Statistics:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>One-Sample t-test: </b>This was used to test the study's null hypotheses (H₀1, H₀2, H₀3). The test value was set at 3 (the neutral point on the Likert scale). A significant result (p < 0.05) would indicate that the mean perception score is significantly different from neutral, allowing for the rejection of the null hypotheses.</li>
                            <li><b>Independent t-test and ANOVA: </b>These were used to determine if there were significant differences in perceptions based on demographic variables such as gender and class level.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><b>Qualitative Analysis: </b>Responses to the open-ended questions were analyzed using thematic analysis.

                <div class="collapse">
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Geographical Scope: </b>The research was conducted only in public secondary schools within Ikere Local Government Area of Ekiti State. Findings may therefore not be generalized to private schools or schools in other regions without caution.</li>
                        <li><b>Use of Self-Reported Data: </b>Data were obtained through students’ self-reported perceptions. Such responses may be influenced by factors such as social desirability bias or mood at the time of administration, which could affect accuracy.</li>
                        <li><b>Time Constraint: </b>Each questionnaire session was limited to approximately 10–15 minutes. This constraint may have restricted the depth of students’ responses, especially for the open-ended items.</li>
                        <li><b>Non-Participation of Absentees: </b>Only students present during the administration of the instrument were included. Students absent at the time of data collection were excluded, which could slightly affect the representativeness of the sample.</li>
                        <li><b>Reliance on Conceptual Understanding: </b>The study measures perception based on the standardized orientation and simulated use of AI chatbots. While this approach provided a uniform conceptual understanding for all participants, students did not engage in actual hands-on interaction with the technology. Therefore, the findings represent students' initial informed perceptions rather than perceptions formed after practical use.</li>
