            <h4 id="background"> Background of the Study</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>Education has long been recognized as the cornerstone of human and societal development, and in today’s world, technology plays a central role in reshaping the way learning takes place. The 21st century has witnessed a rapid transformation in educational practices through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and more recently, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In many parts of the world, AI tools are now being used to provide personalized learning experiences, assist teachers in managing instructional activities, and promote interactive engagement between learners and digital systems. Among the numerous applications of AI, chatbots stand out as one of the most promising innovations for education. Chatbots are AI-driven computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users, often through text or speech, and they are increasingly being adapted to function as virtual tutors capable of guiding students through the learning process.</p>
                <button class="more">Read More</button>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <p>The introduction of AI chatbots into education is particularly relevant to science subjects such as biology, which is a core subject in the Nigerian secondary school curriculum. Biology is not only important because it provides foundational knowledge for advanced studies in medicine, nursing, agriculture, pharmacy, and other life sciences, but also because it develops in students the skills of observation, critical thinking, and problem-solving that are essential for scientific inquiry. Despite its importance, the performance of students in biology has remained poor in many Nigerian schools. Reports from the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) and the National Examinations Council (NECO) consistently reveal that a considerable proportion of candidates fail to obtain credit passes in biology. Researchers and educators have attributed these poor results to various challenges, including inadequate teaching methods, overcrowded classrooms, lack of instructional resources, and the inherent difficulty of certain abstract biology concepts such as genetics, photosynthesis, and ecological interactions. These problems often lead to misconceptions, poor understanding, low interest, and negative attitudes towards the subject among students.</p>
                    <p>Traditional methods of teaching biology in Nigeria remain largely teacher-centered, with much emphasis placed on rote memorization rather than deep understanding. This approach does not adequately cater for the different learning needs of students, especially in contexts where teachers are responsible for very large classes. As a result, many learners are unable to ask questions freely, receive personalized explanations, or engage in meaningful dialogue about difficult concepts. The limitations of this conventional classroom approach have called for the exploration of innovative methods that can supplement teacher efforts and provide students with more individualized support.</p>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence chatbots present a possible solution to some of these challenges. Unlike traditional teaching materials, chatbots are interactive and responsive, offering students immediate answers to questions, step-by-step guidance, and simplified explanations of complex processes. A student struggling with a topic such as cell division or photosynthesis can engage a chatbot and receive feedback in real time, thereby reducing frustration and promoting deeper understanding. Chatbots also support self-paced learning, enabling students to study independently and at their convenience, even outside the classroom. This is particularly useful in Nigeria where students increasingly have access to smartphones and are familiar with digital communication platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram, which operate in a style similar to chatbots. This familiarity suggests that students may find chatbots relatable and user-friendly, thereby making them effective learning tools if properly integrated into the curriculum.</p>
                    <p>However, the success of introducing AI chatbots into biology education does not rest on their availability alone. Their acceptance and usefulness depend greatly on the perception of students who are the primary users. Perception plays a crucial role in shaping attitudes towards any innovation. If students perceive chatbots as beneficial, reliable, and easy to use, they are more likely to embrace them and use them actively in their learning. On the other hand, if they see them as confusing, unnecessary, or unreliable, the integration of such tools may fail, regardless of their potential benefits. This makes it important to assess students’ perception before adopting chatbots on a wide scale in education.</p>
                    <p>Although research on artificial intelligence and chatbots in education is expanding globally, there is still limited evidence from the Nigerian context. In particular, very little is known about how secondary school students in Ekiti State perceive the use of AI chatbots as virtual tutors in learning biology. This lack of empirical data creates a gap that must be addressed, as the perception of students will determine whether such innovations will be embraced or rejected in the local context. Understanding how students view AI chatbots can guide teachers in their instructional practices, help school administrators in making informed decisions about adopting educational technologies, and provide policymakers with evidence to shape curriculum reforms.</p>
                    <p>It is against this backdrop that this study seeks to investigate the perception of secondary school students in Ekiti State on the use of AI chatbots as virtual tutors in learning selected concepts in biology. By focusing on students’ views, the study aims to shed light on how this emerging technology may influence teaching and learning, and how it can be effectively integrated into Nigerian classrooms to improve the teaching and learning of biology.</p>

            <h4 id="statement">Statement of the Problem</h4>
                <div class="box">
                    <p>Biology is one of the core science subjects taught at the secondary school level in Nigeria. It is a prerequisite for many science-based courses in tertiary institutions, including medicine, agriculture, pharmacy, and nursing. Despite its importance, the performance of Nigerian students in biology has remained unsatisfactory over the years. Reports from public examination bodies such as the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) and the National Examinations Council (NECO) consistently highlight poor credit passes in biology. Research evidence attributes these low outcomes to factors such as overcrowded classrooms, teacher-centered instructional methods, abstract nature of some biology concepts, and inadequate individualized support for students.</p>
                <button class="more">Read More</button>
                <div class="collapse">
                    <p>The increasing advancement in technology provides opportunities to address these challenges. Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots, serving as virtual tutors, have the potential to simplify difficult concepts, provide instant feedback, and support self-paced learning. By simulating conversational interaction, chatbots can make learning more engaging and accessible, thereby complementing classroom instruction.</p>
                    <p>However, the introduction of any new instructional innovation does not guarantee its success unless students---the direct users---develop a positive perception towards it. If students perceive AI chatbots as easy to use, beneficial, and effective in improving their understanding of biology, they are more likely to adopt them. Conversely, negative perceptions such as lack of trust, technical difficulties, or poor accessibility may hinder their utilization.</p>
                    <p>At present, little is known about the perception of Nigerian students, particularly in Ekiti State, regarding the use of AI chatbots as virtual tutors in learning biology. Without such knowledge, efforts to integrate AI-powered learning tools into secondary education may face challenges of low acceptance and underutilization.</p>
                    <p>It is against this backdrop that this study seeks to investigate the perception of secondary school students in Ekiti State on the use of AI chatbots as virtual tutors in the learning of selected concepts in biology.</p>

                    <h5><i>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</i></h5>
                    <p>In this study, artificial intelligence refers to computer systems that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, reasoning, answering questions, and interacting with learners in ways that simulate human thinking. AI provides the foundation for chatbots and other digital learning tools used in education.</p>
                    <h5><i>AI Chatbots:</i></h5>
                    <p>AI chatbots are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to interact with users through conversation, either by text or voice. In the context of this study, AI chatbots serve as virtual tutors for biology students, providing explanations, answering questions, and giving immediate feedback on selected biology concepts.</p>
                    <h5><i>Virtual Tutor:	</i></h5>
                    <p>A virtual tutor is a digital assistant or program that helps students learn in a way similar to a human teacher. It guides learners through lessons, answers questions, explains difficult topics, and gives feedback. In this study, AI chatbots function as virtual tutors, helping students understand selected biology concepts at their own pace and in an interactive, easy-to-follow manner.</p>
                    <h5><i>Perception:</i></h5>
                    <p>Perception refers to the opinions, attitudes, beliefs, or feelings of students. This includes their perception of the chatbot's usefulness, ease of use, and effectiveness in improving their understanding of biology concepts.</p>
                    <h5><i>Selected Concepts in Biology:</i></h5>
                    <p>n this study, selected concepts in biology refer to specific topics that students learn in their biology lessons. These include areas such as genetics, cell biology, microbiology, ecology, anatomy and physiology, and evolution and adaptation, which are commonly taught in secondary schools and often considered challenging. The study examines students’ perceptions of using AI chatbots as virtual tutors to understand how these concepts could potentially be learned.</p>
